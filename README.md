PowBot is a Discord-based bot written in [discord.js](https://discord.js.org), mainly focused in programming-themed utility commands.

This bot is currently in a very early development stage. As such, you'll find that this README is pretty bland.

Thanks for taking a gander at this humble repository. PowBot will continue to be developed, so do check back for more updates.
