The Janitor is a multipurpose Discord-based bot written in [discord.js](https://discord.js.org), mainly focused in utility, moderation and memes.

This bot is currently in a very early development stage,. As such, you'll find that this README is pretty bland.

Do take a look at [`FEATURES.md`](FEATURES.md) for a guide on the commands of The Janitor, or take a look at the bot releases on the column on your right.

Thanks for taking a gander at this humble repository. The Janitor will continue to be developed, so do check back for more updates.
